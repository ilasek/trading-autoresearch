# Distilled Learnings

Read this before proposing any hypothesis. Add to it when a pattern repeats
across experiments; prune entries that later evidence contradicts.

## Data & methodology caveats (permanent)

- **Survivorship bias**: the universe is today's constituents. Single-stock alpha
  (especially momentum/quality tilts on stocks) will look better than it was.
  ETF-level strategies are the most trustworthy results in this repo.
- **Free daily data**: Yahoo-adjusted closes; no intraday, no fundamentals, no
  point-in-time constituents. Costs are modeled at 15 bps/side — strategies whose
  edge dies below ~30 bps round-trip are not robust here.
- **Every trial raises the bar**: the deflated-Sharpe benchmark grows with the
  trial count in `experiments/trials.jsonl`. Sweeping parameters wastes shared budget —
  test ideas, not knobs.

## Strategy learnings (append below)

- **De-risking overlays on momentum reliably backfire out-of-sample.** Three distinct
  attempts to fix the champion's 2008-09 momentum-crash drawdown — inverse-vol basket
  weighting + vol targeting, per-asset 200dma trend filtering on an ETF sleeve, and a
  binary SPY-trend regime switch — all cut the *train-period* drawdown substantially
  but lost more validation Sharpe than they saved (0.71, 0.51, 0.51 vs champion's
  0.86), mostly via diluted upside or whipsaw turnover. Any future crash-mitigation
  idea should be judged on its own out-of-sample turnover/whipsaw cost, not just its
  in-sample crash-period behavior.
- **Standalone diversified ETF sleeves cap out well below the champion.** Static
  equal-weight (0.49 Sharpe) and true inverse-vol risk parity (0.35 Sharpe) on the
  same ~10-asset global sleeve both underperform — risk-weighting even did *worse*
  than capital-weighting here, because it overweights low-return bond legs. This is
  now a fairly well-established floor: pure asset-class diversification without a
  return/momentum signal is not competitive on this universe.
- **Blending beats switching.** The one near-miss so far: holding the ETF sleeve
  *alongside* momentum (80/20 capital blend, always on) came within 0.015 Sharpe of
  the champion while also improving both train and validation max drawdown — better
  than any gate/switch/reweight attempt. Combination-family ideas that keep both
  legs always-on and let low correlation do the work look more promising than
  regime-timing the allocation.
- **Low-vol stock tilt is refuted, standalone and as a within-momentum filter.**
  Bottom-quintile trailing-vol stocks alone (val Sharpe 0.69) and lowest-vol names
  *within* the top-momentum quintile (val Sharpe 0.64, worse than either alone) both
  underperform the champion. The double-sort mechanism actively hurts: filtering a
  high-momentum pool by low vol discards the pool's strongest compounders (the
  highest-conviction, often higher-vol names) in favor of the weakest names that
  barely qualified. Treat the whole low-vol family as closed on this universe absent
  a genuinely different vol construction (e.g. sector-neutralized, not raw trailing).
- **Inverse-vol / risk-weighting between sleeves of unequal diversification always
  favors the more-diversified (lower-return) leg.** Confirmed twice now:
  `risk_parity_multi_asset` (inverse-vol across a 10-ETF sleeve underweighted the
  return-carrying equity/EM/commodity legs, 0.35 Sharpe) and `mom_etf_volweighted_blend`
  (inverse-vol weighting between the 15-stock momentum basket and the 10-ETF sleeve
  handed the ETF sleeve the majority of capital on average — not just during
  turbulence — cutting the fixed-80/20 blend's 0.85 Sharpe down to 0.76). A
  concentrated basket is structurally higher-vol than a diversified one almost
  regardless of its return quality, so naive inverse-vol comparison between sleeves
  of different concentration is not a sound weighting mechanism here. Fixed-ratio
  blending remains the better mechanism than any vol-based reweighting tried so far.
- **Momentum + short-term reversal blend is the strongest lead in the repo.** Two
  independent constructions — an 80/20 two-basket capital blend of 12-1 momentum
  (skip-month excluded) with monthly (21-day) short-term reversal, and a single
  composite z-score ranking of the same two signals — both landed at validation
  Sharpe ~0.87, the first candidates ever to beat the champion's raw validation
  Sharpe (0.865). Both were still REJECTed on the deflated-Sharpe multiple-testing
  bar (~0.90 vs the 0.95 required at trial #14-15), not on the head-to-head
  comparison. The mechanism looks genuine (momentum's SKIP window and the reversal
  signal trade literally disjoint, opposite-signed return horizons of the same
  stocks) and replicates across constructions, so it's worth one more genuinely
  different attempt in a future session — but NOT a sweep of the blend ratio or
  z-score weights, which would spend trials on a knob. A construction that also cuts
  turnover (currently 8-9x validation, well up from the champion's 5.8x) is the most
  promising angle, since it could improve net-of-cost Sharpe enough to clear the bar
  outright rather than needing a smaller trial-count denominator.
